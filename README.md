# RAG-from-A2Z
# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) From First Principles
*A Jupyter Notebook Tutorial for Understanding and Implementing RAG with LangChain*

---

##  Overview

This repository is a **notebook-based tutorial** that walks you through the **concepts, architecture, and implementation** of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system from first principles.

The goal is to help you understand how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be combined with **retrieval systems** to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and explainable responses — especially when working with **private or domain-specific data**.

##  What You Will Learn

1. **Conceptual Understanding**  
   - What is RAG and why is it needed?  
   - The limitations of standalone LLMs  
   - Retrieval and Generation phases explained  

2. **Practical Implementation**  
   - Building a simple RAG pipeline from scratch  
   - Loading and chunking text data  
   - Creating and querying vector databases  
   - Integrating retrieval with an LLM via LangChain  

3. **End-to-End Workflow**  
   - Document ingestion  
   - Embedding generation  
   - Semantic search  
   - Context-aware answer generation
